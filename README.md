# psilodep_modelling

Matlab code for Vohryzek et al paper in Brain Communications

1. Experimental Results are reproduced with p0_LEiDA_PSILODEP.m
2. Modelling paradigm has been run on a cluster with modelling codes from Deco et al. 2019, PNAS - p1_optimze_hopf_effective_psilodep.m, p2_perturb_hopf_psilodep.m
3. Perturbational Results are reproduced with p3_PSILODEP_perturbation_results.

Data to reproduce the figures can be provided upon request.
